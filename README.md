# iocs-collect

# Threat Feed Collector

This is the **core component** responsible for downloading and storing malicious IP and URL addresses into a PostgreSQL database. It relies on an own library [`db-utils`](https://github.com/iocs-project/db-utils) for database connection management and requires all SQL scripts to be applied before runtime, handled by the companion project [`db-postgre-sql`](https://github.com/iocs-project/db-postgre-sql).

The application supports both **data ingestion** from external sources and **searching** for known threats in the database.

## ðŸ“š Overview

- Downloads malicious IP and URL feeds.
- Stores the data in a PostgreSQL database.
- Provides functionality to search for known threats.
- Depends on a PostgreSQL deployment managed via `db-postgre-sql`.

---

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Docker Compose

---

## ðŸš€ Setup

The easiest way to start the entire system is by running:

```bash
./run.sh
```
